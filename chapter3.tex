\section{Usage of the designed software}

The designed monitoring software is made to be part of the system created for the Future Internet Research, Services and Technology project started by ETIK organization. The system is a prototype of a sensor network where the output of sensors can be used to create so called virtual sensors and store the data in a central data store. The system can reason using the ontology built on the sensors. A detailed introduction can be found in this chapter.

\section{Goal of the project}

The project's goal is to show a prototype of a cyberphisical system. It should contain sample sensors, a central database and also a planner, which plans the deployment of the designed new processes or virtual sensors. The system should prove using small example use cases that such a system is feasible to build.
